[This video goes over some common mathematical symbols](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNK9RuvEp30) and how those symbols translate into computer code. In this example, I'm using Python and NumPy to help with the caluclations. 

This is a great video if you are interested in the links between mathematics and programming.
